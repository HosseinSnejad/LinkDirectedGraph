Discovery of binding motifs and epitopes is critical in detec-
tion of cancers in early stages. Considerable efforts have been focused
on introducing methods to discover regulatory motifs. However, those
methods face serious challenges when dealing with NGS data: many of
them are not scalable for large data sets, require prior knowledge about
the number of motifs to identify, and have low accuracy. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach which relies on results from theory of in-
tersection graphs
